This repository contains the MATLAB code and experimental data accompanying the article:
“Tactile Perception through Fluid–Solid Interaction.”

**Raw Data Processing**

The Raw Data Processing folder includes MATLAB scripts used to process the experimental data, converting collected signals into pressure and force measurements.
Example datasets are provided for:

- 1D sensor diameter of 1.5mm for all 3 media

- 2D sensor

- Underwater 1D sensor

**Learning**

The Learning folder contains MATLAB code for fuzzy clustering, used to train and analyze the dataset.
Example data includes:

- 1D oil sensor with 100 cSt viscosity and 1.5 mm diameter

- 2D 60×60 sensor

These datasets correspond to those used in the paper.
